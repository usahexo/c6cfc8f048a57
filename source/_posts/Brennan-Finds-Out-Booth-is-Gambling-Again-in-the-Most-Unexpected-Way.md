Booth is at a loss for what to do and winds up going to a casino to try and win back some of the money he's lost. He ends up winning big, but only because he's using Brennan's money.

Booth knows he needs to come clean with Brennan about what he's been doing, but he's not sure how she'll react. When he finally tells her, Brennan is hurt, but she also understands why Booth did it. They both agree to get help for their gambling addiction and work on repairing their relationship.

It is a scene that has played out in many households: the disappointment and frustration of a loved one upon learning of an addiction. For Brennan, this was the reality when she discovered that her husband Booth had a gambling addiction. In Season 9, Episode 21 "The Cast in the Cave", Brennan learned of Booth's addiction just as he was seemingly turning a corner.

Booth had been secretive about his gambling, and Brennan only learned of it when she found out that he had not been paying his debts. This led to a confrontation between the two in which Brennan expressed her disappointment and anger. Booth tried to defend himself, explaining that he had been trying to stop gambling but had failed. Brennan was not convinced, and she made it clear that she did not want him to gamble anymore.

The exchange between Brennan and Booth was emotional and difficult. It was clear that both of them were struggling with the revelation of Booth's addiction. Brennan was hurt by Booth's secretiveness and felt like she could not trust him anymore. Booth was ashamed of his addiction and felt like he had let Brennan down.

However, over time they were able to work through their issues. They discussed Booth's addiction openly and honestly, and Brennan continued to support him as he sought treatment. Ultimately, their relationship survived this challenging time and they were able to move forward together.

Brennan walked up to Booth and asked him what he was doing. He tried to play coy, but she wasn't having it. She told him that she had seen him gambling and that she knew it was because he needed money. Booth tried to argue with her, but she wasn't going to let him get away with it.

She told him that she was done with him and that she wanted him to leave her alone. It was clear that this wasn't easy for her, but she was determined to stand up for herself. Booth finally realized that he wasn't going to be able to talk his way out of this and he left.
