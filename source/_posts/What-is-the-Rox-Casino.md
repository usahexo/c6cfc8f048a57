#  What are the Pittsburgh Pirates?

The Pittsburgh Pirates are a professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pirates compete in the National League (NL) Central division. They are one of the two old-guard teams of the NL Central, along with the St. Louis Cardinals, having joined the league in 1887 as one of its eight charter members.

The Pirates have won five World Series championships (1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979) and nine National League pennants (1901, 1902, 1903, 1909, 1925, 1927, 1960, 1971, and 1979). They played in the first World Series in 1903 and also lost in the 1919 World Series against the Boston Red Sox. Charlie Morton is their current most notable player.

# Brief History

The modern day Pirates formed in 1881 as Allegheny. The following season they merged with another club called Eclipse to become Pittsburgh. In their early days they were known as one of the most talented clubs in baseball but also one of the most headstrong and difficult to manage. They made it to their first World Series (then best-of-nine format) in 1903 but would lose to Boston 4 games to 3.

They would go on to appear in three more WS over the next few decades but never win it all. In fact, they lost back-to-back series against Detroit in 1909 and again in 1934. It wasn’t until 1925 that they finally got over the hump, knocking off Detroit Tigers 4 games to 3 for their first championship title. Led by legendary outfielder “Pie” Traynor and Hall of Fame pitcher Waite Hoyt among others, this squad is considered one of the best Pirate teams of all time.

Pittsburgh wouldn’t win another title until 1960 - a full 35 years later! This team was led by Roberto Clemente - a 12-time All Star and eventual Hall of Famer - who hit .317 with 29 homers and 107 RBIs that season en route to a world championship. Other notable players from that squad include Bill Mazeroski - who hit arguably the most famous home run in MLB history to clinch game 7 of the 1960 WS - Dick Groat and Vernon Law. The 1971 team was led by Al Oliver & Willie Stargell and featured future Hall of Famers such as Roberto Clemente & Bill Mazeroski. 

The 1979 Pirates were led by veteran catcher Mike Easler & slugger Willie Stargell who both hit over .300 that year while driving in well over 100 runs apiece. This team would finally bring another championship back to Pittsburgh with a thrilling 5 game victory over Baltimore Orioles. And thus ended what has been called “The Curse of Bobby Bonilla” which had befallen the pirate organization since he inexplicably refused a contract extension offer from them after being named MVP of 1985 NLCS. 

Pittsburgh has continued to be a competitive team into recent years but unfortunately has not been able to bring home another championship trophy just yet despite making it deep into playoffs on multiple occasions (including losing appearances in 2013 & 2015 NL Wild Card games).
