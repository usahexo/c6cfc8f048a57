#  Derren Brown Says 'Russian Roulette' Was a Fake

Derren Brown, the famous British illusionist, mentalist, and self-proclaimed "psychic" has come forward to say that the Russian Roulette stunt that made him famous was faked.

Brown first performed the Russian Roulette stunt in 2000, on a UK game show called "The Heist." In the stunt, Brown appeared to load a gun with one bullet and then challenged two volunteers from the audience to play Russian Roulette with him. One of the volunteers was then apparently shot in the head.

But now, 17 years later, Brown has come forward to say that the whole thing was faked. In a new program premiering tomorrow on Channel 4 in the UK called "Beyond Magic," Brown reveals how he staged the entire stunt.

In a promotional video for the new program, Brown says that he used rubber bullets and blanks to fake the gunshot. He also reveals how he persuaded the volunteer who was supposedly shot to keep quiet about what had really happened.

Brown says that he wanted to reveal how he faked the Russian Roulette stunt all these years ago, but his TV producers wouldn't let him. "I wanted to tell everyone immediately, but I was contractually obliged not to," Brown says in the video.

So why did Brown finally decide to come clean now? He says it's because he's "sick of people thinking I'm psychic."

Despite this revelation, many of Derren Brown's fans are still standing by him. Some say that even if it was fake, it's still an amazing feat of illusionism. And others say that they don't care if it was fake or not – they still think Derren Brown is amazing.

Derren Brown astounds audiences once again by winning at Russian Roulette.

He began the stunt by loading one bullet into a six-chamber revolver. He then spun the gun around on the table several times before pointing it at his head and pulling the trigger. The gun didn't go off.

He then loaded two bullets into the gun and repeated the process. This time, the gun fired, but Derren was unharmed.

Audiences were amazed that he had managed to beat Russian Roulette, especially given that it is said that only one in six shots results in death.
