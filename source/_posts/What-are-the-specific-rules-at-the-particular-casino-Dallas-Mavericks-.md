#  What are the specific rules at the particular casino Dallas Mavericks? 

The Dallas Mavericks are a professional basketball team located in Dallas, Texas. The team is a member of the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Mavericks began play in the 1980–81 NBA season as an expansion team.

The following rules are specific to playing at the Dallas Mavericks Casino:

1. All players must be 21 years or older.
2. All players must have a government-issued photo ID to verify age and identity. 
3. Management reserves the right to refuse service to anyone. 
4. Gambling is illegal in Texas, and players should familiarize themselves with state law before participating in any casino games offered at the Dallas Mavericks Casino. 
5. Games are won and lost based on the cards shown, and all decisions are final. 
6. Players are not allowed to touch or move any game chips or cards on the table, except during their own turn. 
7. In roulette, blackjack, and Three Card Poker, if both dealer's cards are equal (opposite colors or suits), then no bets will be paid and no cards will be exchanged; this is called a "push". 
8. In roulette and Three Card Poker, players may only bet one chip at a time on any given bet type; doubling down is not allowed. 
9. In blackjack, players may only split a hand once per game; splitting Aces results in two hands totaling 1 point each instead of two hands totaling 2 points each. 10."Insurance" is not offered in blackjack; when the dealer has an Ace showing as their upcard, they have already insured themselves against losing by drawing another card that would make them bust (go over 21).  11."Hit" means to take another card from the deck; "Stand" means to stop taking cards and end your turn."Double down" means doubling your bet and taking just one more card from the deck (you cannot hit after doubling down).  12."Soft 17" refers to any hand where the ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points without going over 21; for example, Ace-6-4 would be a soft 17.. 13."Split" means to divide your hand into two separate hands, each comprised of exactly one card from each of your two original hands (ie: if you are dealt two Kings, you may split them into two separate hands). 14."Surrender" means giving up half your bet immediately after seeing your first two cards (ie: if you are dealt an Ace & King of different suits as your first two cards, you would surrender rather than splitting them).

#  Are there any variations in how to play craps at the particular casino Dallas Mavericks compared to other casinos? 

Craps enthusiasts might be wondering if the particular casino Dallas Mavericks operates differently compared to other casinos. The answer, however, is no. There are actually only a few basic rules for playing craps that are universally followed in all casinos. 

First and foremost, all players must place a bet on the table before the dice can be thrown. The game begins with the player closest to the dice throwing them towards the opposite end of the table. Players can bet on either the Pass Line or Don’t Pass Line, which respectively gives players winning odds if the dice land on 7 or 11, or losing odds if the dice land on 2 or 3. Other betting options include Point Bets, which allow players to wager on a specific number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) being rolled before a 7 is thrown; Field Bets, which are bets placed on whether the next roll will be 1 through 12; and Horn bets that cover 2, 3, 11, and 12 as specific numbers. 

As with any casino game, there is always some element of chance involved in craps. However, by following these simple guidelines and paying attention to what others players are betting on, you too can enjoy this exciting and social game at your favorite casino!
