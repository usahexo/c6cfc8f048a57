#  How To Make Money Sports Betting: Tips From Hornets Fans

In the NBA, the Charlotte Hornets are a team that perennially finds themselves on the bubble. This season, they are in a similar position. Entering February, they were in 10th place in the Eastern Conference but just four games out of the playoffs. The Hornets’ fans are some of the most passionate in the league, and many of them like to make money sports betting on their team. So, what are the best tips for making money betting on the Hornets?

The first step is to understand how odds work. In basketball, there are three possible outcomes: Team A wins, Team B wins, or it’s a draw. When you bet on a game, you’re essentially betting on one of those outcomes. Oddsmakers will set a line for each outcome, and you can then bet on which side you think will cover (win by more than the spread) or which team will win outright. For example, if Team A is favored by 7 points over Team B, that means that most people believe that Team A will win by more than 7 points. So if you think that Team B will upset Team A, you would bet on them to cover (win by more than 7 points).

The second step is to do your homework. Know who is injured, who is hot and who is not, and what the standings look like in both conferences. This information can give you an edge when betting on NBA games. For example, if you know that the Golden State Warriors are without their superstar Steph Curry but the Boston Celtics are without their superstar Kyrie Irving, you might want to take Boston as an underdog in that matchup.

The third step is to be patient. Don’t bet with your emotions; always make decisions with your head instead of your heart. This can be tough when betting on games involving your favorite team, but it’s important to remember that no one has a crystal ball and that sports betting is all about making calculated risks.

Finally, don’t be afraid to take risks every now and then - but always make sure that they are calculated risks! As mentioned earlier, NBA games have three possible outcomes and each one has its own odds associated with it. That means that there is value to be had when betting on certain outcomes - especially if you can get better odds than what the books are offering.
