#  Slot machines are paused for man found dead inside

The machines were turned off and security was called after a man was found dead inside a gambling area at a casino in Maryland.

The victim was identified as 41-year-old Derrick King of Baltimore. Officials say he died from an apparent gunshot wound.

“This is still under investigation, but it appears that this is not a random act,” Anne Arundel County police spokesperson Marc Limansky said.

Police are looking for any information on the incident and are asking anyone with information to come forward.

This tragic incident comes just days after a deadly shooting at a Florida gaming center. Monday night, authorities say 21-year-old David Katz killed two people and injured 10 others before turning the gun on himself.

#  Police investigating death of man at casino slot machine

Police are investigating the death of a man at a casino slot machine. The 54-year-old victim was found dead at the machine with a needle in his arm. An autopsy is scheduled to determine the cause of death, but police say it appears to be drug-related.

This is not the first time a casino patron has died from a drug overdose. In 2015, a 20-year-old woman died from an overdose at a casino in Atlantic City. And in 2012, a 37-year-old man fatally overdosed at a casino in Connecticut.

Casinos are filled with people looking to have some fun and escape the reality of their lives. But for some, that escape can be deadly. Drug addiction is a serious problem, and casinos are often one of the places where addicts go to get their fix.

The good news is that casinos are becoming more aware of the problem and are taking steps to prevent overdose deaths. In 2017, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City began offering naloxone kits to its employees in case of an overdose emergency. Other casinos are likely to follow suit.

In the meantime, if you know someone who is addicted to drugs, please urge them to get help. There is no shame in seeking treatment for addiction – in fact, it’s courageous. Addiction is a powerful force that can take over your life if you let it. But there is hope for recovery, and there are many people who have successfully overcome addiction.
