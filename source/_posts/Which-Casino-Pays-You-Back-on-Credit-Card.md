#  Which Casino Pays You Back on Credit Card?

Whenever you are looking to gamble, the first thing you need to do is find a reputable and safe online casino. The last thing you want is to have your personal information compromised or wind up losing money that you can't afford to lose. So, how do you figure out which casinos are legitimate and which ones might be best to avoid? 

One way to narrow down your search is by looking at which casinos offer bonuses for using specific payment methods. For example, some casinos will give you back a percentage of your deposit amount when you use a credit card. This could be an incentive for players who are hesitant about using their credit card information online. 

So, which casino pays back on credit card deposits? According to our research, the following three casinos offer the best bonus rewards for Credit Card users: Slotland Casino, Win A Day Casino, and Lincoln Casino. 

Each one of these casinos offers different rewards depending on the payment method that you choose. But in general, they all offer a higher percentage return when you use a Credit Card instead of other methods like e-wallets or prepaid cards. 

Of course, there are many other reputable and safe online casinos to choose from. But if you're looking for one that gives you back something extra for using your Credit Card, then these three should definitely be at the top of your list!

#  Who Pays Back Your Credit Card Fees at the Casino?

When you swipe your credit card at the casino, who pays the fees? The answer may surprise you.

Technically, the casino does. Credit card companies charge merchants a fee for each transaction. This fee is generally a percentage of the sale amount, and it can be anywhere from 1-3%. So, if you purchase $100 worth of chips with your credit card, the casino will likely have to pay $3 in credit card fees.

Of course, the casino isn't really losing any money in this scenario. They simply pass on the cost of the fees to the customer in the form of higher prices on games and services. So, when you're playing blackjack and see that the table minimum is $10, that includes an extra $0.30 to cover the credit card fee.

In most cases, casinos are willing to eat these costs since they know that customers are more likely to use credit cards than cash. In fact, many casinos no longer even accept cash as a form of payment.

In some cases, however, casinos will refuse to pay credit card fees. This usually happens when players are trying to withdraw winnings from their account. In this scenario, the casino will contact the credit card company and have them refund the fees directly to the player.

So, who pays your credit card fees at the casino? Technically, it's the casino. But in reality, it's really just passed on to you in the form of higher prices.
