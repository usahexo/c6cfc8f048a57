#  Cleo Gaming Launches In Cambodia 

Cleo Gaming, the first and only e-sports company in Cambodia, was founded in early 2017 by Kao Sour and Ot Samnang. The company has set its sights on becoming the leading e-sports organisation in Southeast Asia.

Cleo Gaming is the result of years of experience in the gaming industry between Kao and Ot. Kao is a former competitive Counter-Strike player who represented Cambodia at regional tournaments while Ot has been involved in organising gaming tournaments across the country.

The company’s inaugural event, the Cleo Gaming Championship, took place in April 2017. The tournament brought together gamers from all over Cambodia for four days of intense competition in games such as DOTA 2, League of Legends, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 

The Cleo Gaming Championship was a success, with over 100 gamers competing for a share of $2,000 worth of prizes. The top three teams in each game received cash prizes, with the winning team taking home $1,000. 

Cleo Gaming is now planning even bigger events for 2018. These will include larger prize pools and participation from teams from other countries in Southeast Asia.

#  Play Your Cards Right And Spend A Night With Cleo 

The first time I ever saw Cleo was at a casino in Reno. She was sitting at one of the blackjack tables, and I couldn't help but notice her long, lithe body and her gorgeous face. I introduced myself, and we started talking. It didn't take long for me to realize that she was one of the most beautiful women I had ever met.

We ended up spending the night together, and I have to say that it was definitely worth it. Cleo is an amazing lover, and she knows how to please a man. If you're looking for a night of passion and pleasure, then you need to spend some time with Cleo. She'll make you feel like a king!
