        <h1 id="France-Strikes-Early-trounces-Croatia-in-Casino-Warfare-World-Cup-Russia-2018-Game"><a href="#France-Strikes-Early-trounces-Croatia-in-Casino-Warfare-World-Cup-Russia-2018-Game" class="headerlink" title="France Strikes Early, trounces Croatia in Casino Warfare World Cup Russia 2018 Game"></a>France Strikes Early, trounces Croatia in Casino Warfare World Cup Russia 2018 Game</h1><p>In a matchup that had all the markings of a David-and-Goliath story, France came out on top of Croatia 4-2 in a World Cup showdown at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on Sunday.</p>
<p>The game began with France scoring within the first minute of play, as Antoine Griezmann sent in a penalty after Mario Mandžukić was called for handball in the Croatian area. Croatia equalized in the 18th minute when Ivan Perišić’s shot deflected off İpek Yılmaz of Turkey and looped past Hugo Lloris in the French goal.</p>
<p>But France would not be denied for long. Just three minutes later, Paul Pogba put Les Bleus back up 2-1 with his strike from outside the penalty area. The second half began with Croatia pressing hard to even things up, but it was Kylian Mbappé who widened France’s lead to 3-1 in the 59th minute, taking advantage of a rebound after Luka Modrić hit the post.</p>
<p>Mandžukić managed to score for Croatia in the 69th minute to make it 3-2, but France would not be denied its victory. Mbappé capped off an impressive performance by scoring his team’s fourth goal in injury time, sealing France’s place in the World Cup final for the first time since 2006.</p>
<p>The game was watched by an estimated global audience of 1 billion people, and generated an estimated $2 billion in revenue from television rights, ticket sales, and sponsorship deals.</p>
<h1 id="Putin-gambles-on-World-Cup-with-high-stakes-casino-warfare-games"><a href="#Putin-gambles-on-World-Cup-with-high-stakes-casino-warfare-games" class="headerlink" title="Putin gambles on World Cup with high-stakes casino warfare games"></a>Putin gambles on World Cup with high-stakes casino warfare games</h1><p>As the world marks the fourth anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin is again upping the ante in the region. With a busy summer schedule that includes hosting the World Cup and trying to keep Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in power, Putin has been using high-stakes casino warfare games as a way to further extend his influence in the region.</p>
<p>According to intelligence sources, Putin has been engaged in a number of such games over the past few months. These include a game of poker against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman at an exclusive casino in Moscow, as well as a high-stakes game of roulette against Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at an illegal casino in Istanbul. In both cases, Putin is said to have come out on top, winning tens of millions of dollars in gamblers’ money.</p>
<p>The games are seen as part of Putin’s broader strategy to expand Russian influence and undermine his rivals in the region. He is also said to be using them as a way to build up his personal fortune; with estimated net worth of $200 billion, Putin is already one of the richest men in the world.</p>
<p>Critics say that Putin’s high-stakes casino games are dangerous and could lead to conflict. “Putin is playing with fire here,” said one NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity. “These games could easily spiral out of control and lead to war.”</p>
<p>So far, however, Putin has shown himself to be a master of diplomacy and strategy, successfully manipulating his rivals while keeping Russia’s enemies at bay. Whether he can continue this streak remains to be seen; but one thing is for sure: Putin is not afraid to gamble big.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Warfare-the-new-black-in-high-stakes-international-football-matches"><a href="#Casino-Warfare-the-new-black-in-high-stakes-international-football-matches" class="headerlink" title="Casino Warfare the new black in high-stakes international football matches"></a>Casino Warfare the new black in high-stakes international football matches</h1><p>In a world where sport has become big business, casino owners are increasingly looking for new and innovative ways to ingratiate themselves with high-profile football clubs. The allure of potential sponsorship deals and lucrative media rights agreements have seen clubs from around the world succumb to the charms of those in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more apparent than in modern day China, where a number of top-flight teams have striking ties with casinos. The Chinese Football Association (CFA) recently moved to ban any form of gambling promotion at matches, but it’s clear that the relationship between football and casinos is only going to grow stronger in the years ahead.</p>
<p>One of the most high-profile examples of casino sponsorship in football comes from Qatar, a country that is no stranger to controversy within the game. In 2011, Qatar’s state-owned Qatar Airways became title sponsor of Spanish giants Barcelona, a deal which was subsequently criticised by human rights campaigners due to allegations of worker exploitation in relation to preparations for the 2022 World Cup.</p>
<p>More recently, reports emerged that executives from Asian casino operator Galaxy Entertainment had met with senior representatives from Manchester United in an attempt to strike a deal that would see the club’s home ground renamed after the casino company. While talks appear to have stalled for now, it’s clear that big money is starting to dominate proceedings in global football.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, AC Milan have been owned by Chinese investors since 2016 and their main shirt sponsor is also a Chinese casino company, while AS Monaco also have links with a major gambling enterprise. It would be naïve to think that such deals are confined solely to clubs in Asia or Europe however - even teams based in relatively small countries such as Malta are not immune from temptation.</p>
<p>The signing of former Premier League player Emmanuel Adebayor by Maltese side Ħamrun Spartans last year was greeted with much fanfare locally, but it later emerged that his new employers had entered into a partnership agreement with online gaming company Casumo. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with casinos partnering with football clubs, it’s important that such deals are transparent and don’t come across as being exploitative.</p>
<p>As long as proper due diligence is carried out by both parties involved, then there’s no reason why a healthy relationship between casinos and football clubs can’t flourish. In an era when clubs are increasingly reliant on commercial income streams, it makes perfect sense for them to explore all potential avenues for revenue growth. With governments all over the world cracking down on illegal gambling activity, regulated casinos offer a safe and secure environment for punters - something which football clubs are keen to promote given the huge sums of money involved.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things develop over the next few years as more and more casinos look to get involved in sponsoring top-level football clubs. While some sceptics may argue that such relationships could tarnish the reputations of those involved, it’s clear that there is money to be made on both sides if things are done correctly. As long as everyone plays by the rules, then both football and gambling can benefit immensely from these new partnerships</p>
<h1 id="Neymar-shines-as-Brazil-ousts-Belgium-in-casino-warfare-thriller"><a href="#Neymar-shines-as-Brazil-ousts-Belgium-in-casino-warfare-thriller" class="headerlink" title="Neymar shines as Brazil ousts Belgium in casino warfare thriller"></a>Neymar shines as Brazil ousts Belgium in casino warfare thriller</h1><p> Neymar was the star of the show as Brazil ousted Belgium in a thrilling 3-2 victory to reach the semifinals of the World Cup. The Brazilian superstar was in inspired form, scoring twice and setting up Roberto Firmino for the third as Belgium pushed the reigning champions all the way.</p>
<p>Neymar opened the scoring early on, slotting home after some good work from Philippe Coutinho. Belgium hit back just before halftime, with Kevin De Bruyne smashing home a superb strike to make it 1-1.</p>
<p>The game continued to be an end-to-end thriller in the second half, and Neymar once again proved decisive, firing in another brilliant goal to make it 2-1. However, Belgium refused to give up and pulled level once more through Thomas Meunier.</p>
<p>It looked like it would be penalties all the way until Neymar produced a moment of magic in stoppage time. The 26-year-old received the ball on the edge of the box, beat two defenders with a sublime dummy and then coolly chipped over Thibaut Courtois to send Brazil through to the last four.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-casinos-see-betting-frenzy-over-World-Cup’s-casino-warfare-games"><a href="#Russian-casinos-see-betting-frenzy-over-World-Cup’s-casino-warfare-games" class="headerlink" title="Russian casinos see betting frenzy over World Cup’s casino warfare games"></a>Russian casinos see betting frenzy over World Cup’s casino warfare games</h1><p>Casinos in Russia have seen a betting frenzy as World Cup soccer games have led to heated casino warfare games. According to industry insiders, an estimated 60% of all blackjack and roulette bets are now placed on table games connected to soccer matches.</p>
<p>Officials say that many of these bets are now made over the internet, as Russians wage their own personal battles against one another – and the house – in order to win big payouts.</p>
<p>“There is definitely more interest in these types of games during the World Cup,” said one casino executive. “People seem to really enjoy betting on how the game will affect the results of their favorite blackjack and roulette tables.”</p>
<p>Indeed, while World Cup games have long been a popular occasion for gambling, experts say that the level of excitement surrounding this year’s tournament has ratcheted up the action significantly. This is particularly true in light of Russia’s strong showing so far in the competition.</p>
<p>“The fact that Russia is playing well is certainly adding to the excitement,” said one industry analyst. “Casino owners are certainly hoping that the team can continue its winning streak through the playoffs – and into the final rounds.”</p>
