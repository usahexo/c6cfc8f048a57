        <h1 id="Casino-unveils-new-addition-play-craps"><a href="#Casino-unveils-new-addition-play-craps" class="headerlink" title="Casino unveils new addition - play craps!"></a>Casino unveils new addition - play craps!</h1><p>The casino has just announced that it is adding craps to its repertoire of games. Craps is a dice game in which players place bets on the outcome of the roll, or series of rolls, of two dice. The game has been around for centuries and is a favorite among gamblers.</p>
<p>The casino has gone all out with this new addition, investing in top-of-the-line craps tables and hiring experienced dealers. There are already several enthusiastic players giving it a try and the excitement is building!</p>
<p>So what is the attraction of craps? First of all, it is a very fast-paced game, with lots of action. Players can bet on the come out roll or on subsequent rolls, making for plenty of opportunities to win (or lose!) money. Craps also offers some potentially big payouts - a “natural” (a roll of 7 or 11) pays out at 3:2, for example.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy gambling but don’t want to risk too much money, craps may be the perfect game. It’s easy to learn how to play and you can bet as little or as much as you like. Plus, there’s always something happening - you never know when the next big payout is going to come along! So why not head down to the casino and try your luck at craps?</p>
<h1 id="What-do-the-numbers-on-a-roulette-add-up-to-Play-Craps-and-find-out"><a href="#What-do-the-numbers-on-a-roulette-add-up-to-Play-Craps-and-find-out" class="headerlink" title="What do the numbers on a roulette add up to? Play Craps and find out!"></a>What do the numbers on a roulette add up to? Play Craps and find out!</h1><p>If you’re looking to add some excitement to your life and perhaps make a bit of money in the process, then you should definitely check out roulette. But before you do, it’s important to learn about all of the different bets you can make. In this article, we’ll take a look at what the numbers on a roulette wheel add up to and how you can use this information to your advantage when playing Craps.</p>
<p>As we all know, a roulette wheel consists of 36 numbered slots, from 0 to 35. What many people don’t know, however, is that these numbers don’t just randomly appear on the wheel. In fact, each number is specifically positioned in order to create certain patterns and combinations.</p>
<p>For example, the first 12 numbers on the wheel (0-11) are placed in three columns of four numbers each. The second column is made up of the next 12 numbers (12-23), followed by the third column with the last 12 numbers (24-35). This alternating pattern continues all the way around the wheel, creating six distinct groups of two numbers each.</p>
<p>Now that you know how the numbers are positioned on a roulette wheel, let’s take a look at what they add up to. The total sum of all 36 numbers is 666, which is why some people believe that roulette is cursed! Interestingly enough, if you break down 666 into its individual digits (6 + 6 + 6), you get 18. This number appears twice on the roulette wheel (18 and 28) and also happens to be the total amount of money that can be won on a single bet ($9 x 2 = $18).</p>
<p>So how can knowing all of this help you when playing Craps? Well, simply put, it gives you an edge over the house. By understanding where certain numbers are positioned on the wheel and what they add up to, you can make smarter bets and increase your chances of winning big bucks!</p>

But, like any other game, it is important to understand the basics before playing.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes craps so interesting is that there are many different betting options available to players. In this article, we will focus on the basic bets and how to make the most of them.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that craps uses two dice. The aim of the game is to roll a total number that is higher than the dealer’s number without going over 21. If you roll a 7 or 11 then you win immediately, while a 2, 3 or 12 loses. If any other number is rolled then that becomes your point and you must continue rolling until either you hit the point again (in which case you win) or roll a 7 (in which case you lose).</p>
<p>To start off with, let’s look at the pass line bet. This is one of the simplest bets in craps and simply requires you to place your wager on the pass line before the dice are rolled. If a 7 or 11 is rolled on the first go, then you win but if anything else comes up then you lose. The house edge on this bet is 1.41%.</p>
<p>Another simple bet is the come out bet, which can be placed after a point has been established. This simply means betting that the next roll will be something which will enable you to establish another point. If this happens then your original bet will be doubled and if not then it will be lost. The house edge on this bet ranges from 0% (if 7 or 11 come out) to 1.36% (if 3 or 12 come out).</p>
<p>There are also lots of different side bets available in craps, each with their own unique odds. However, it is best to avoid these if you are just starting out as they can be quite complicated. By sticking to the basic bets we have outlined above, you can give yourself a good chance of winning without having to worry too much about complex odds calculations!</p>
