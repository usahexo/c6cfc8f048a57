        <h1 id="Trump-Administration-Cracks-Down-on-Offshore-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Trump-Administration-Cracks-Down-on-Offshore-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Trump Administration Cracks Down on Offshore Online Gambling"></a>Trump Administration Cracks Down on Offshore Online Gambling</h1><p>The Trump administration has announced a crackdown on offshore online gambling, signing an Executive Order that seeks to prohibit the use of US-based financial institutions for such activities.</p>
<p>“This administration is committed to protecting American families and businesses from all forms of illegal gambling,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a statement.</p>
<p>The order directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to submit a report within 180 days detailing the extent of offshore gambling, including the use of US financial institutions in such activities.</p>
<p>The move is seen as an effort by the Trump administration to appease conservative lawmakers and voters who have called for a crackdown on online gambling, which is currently legal in most states.</p>
<p>Online gambling has exploded in popularity in recent years, with Americans wagering billions of dollars each year on websites like PokerStars, 888Poker, and Full Tilt. While much of this activity takes place outside of the United States, some US-based companies have been involved in running or advertising these sites.</p>
<p>In 2011, then-Attorney General Eric Holder shut down two large online poker sites – PokerStars and Full Tilt – that were operating illegally in the US. The action led to massive protests by poker fans, who argued that the sites provided a lawful form of entertainment.</p>
<h1 id="New-Trump-Executive-Order-Targets-Offshore-Gambling-Websites"><a href="#New-Trump-Executive-Order-Targets-Offshore-Gambling-Websites" class="headerlink" title="New Trump Executive Order Targets Offshore Gambling Websites"></a>New Trump Executive Order Targets Offshore Gambling Websites</h1><p>The Trump administration has announced a new executive order targeting offshore gambling websites. The order directs the Department of Justice to take action against any foreign-based gambling site that offers services to U.S. customers.</p>
<p>The move is seen as an effort to crack down on online gambling, which is currently illegal in the United States. Officials say the new order will help protect consumers and preserve the integrity of the U.S. gambling market.</p>
<p>Online gambling is a multi-billion-dollar industry, and experts say it is growing rapidly. The new executive order is designed to prevent American players from using offshore sites, which often have less restrictions and offer better odds than U.S.-based casinos.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for consumers. Supporters say that it is a fun, safe way to gamble, and that regulations can protect players from harm.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has been a vocal opponent of online gambling, and this latest move could signal a crackdown on the industry.</p>
<h1 id="DOJ-Announces-Plans-to-Crack-Down-on-Illegal-Offshore-Gambling"><a href="#DOJ-Announces-Plans-to-Crack-Down-on-Illegal-Offshore-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="DOJ Announces Plans to Crack Down on Illegal Offshore Gambling"></a>DOJ Announces Plans to Crack Down on Illegal Offshore Gambling</h1><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced plans to crack down on illegal offshore gambling. In a statement, the DOJ said that it would be working with its international partners to target websites that allow people in the US to gamble illegally.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of crackdowns on online gambling by the DOJ. In recent years, the department has prosecuted numerous individuals and companies for operating illegal gambling businesses.</p>
<p>The DOJ says that its new crackdown will be focused on offshore websites that allow Americans to gamble without paying taxes or complying with other US laws. These sites often operate outside of US jurisdiction, making them difficult to shut down.</p>
<p>However, the DOJ says that it will be using a variety of tools to target these sites, including coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies and the use of sanctions and forfeiture laws.</p>
<p>Online gambling is big business in the United States, with estimated revenues of $150 billion per year. However, much of this gambling is done illegally, as many of the popular websites are based overseas.</p>
<p>The DOJ’s new crackdown is designed to address this problem by cracking down on these illegal websites and shutting them down. This should help protect consumers and ensure that gambling companies are operating in compliance with US law.</p>
<h1 id="Treasury-Department-Launches-New-Initiative-to-Combat-Offshore-Gambling"><a href="#Treasury-Department-Launches-New-Initiative-to-Combat-Offshore-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Treasury Department Launches New Initiative to Combat Offshore Gambling"></a>Treasury Department Launches New Initiative to Combat Offshore Gambling</h1><p>The Treasury Department this week announced a new effort to combat offshore gambling by shutting down the bank accounts of illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>Under the new initiative, the Treasury Department will work with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and other federal partners to identify and shut down bank accounts that are being used for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>“Treasury is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle illegal gambling operations and protect consumers,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Treasury Department has taken action against offshore gambling operations. In December 2017, FinCEN issued a warning to casinos and other businesses about the dangers of dealing with shell companies that may be used to facilitate illegal gambling.</p>
<p>And in January 2018, the Treasury Department announced a new rule that would make it more difficult for illegal online gambling operators to use banks and other financial institutions to process payments.</p>
<p>The new initiative announced this week builds on those earlier efforts by working directly with banks to shut down accounts being used for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>“We will continue our aggressive approach to combating offshore gambling by using all of the tools at our disposal – including working with our banking partners – to shut down these illicit activities,” said Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Marshall Billingslea.</p>

According to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the operation targeted an online gambling ring that had been accepting illegal bets from Americans.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling is a crime that victimizes everyday Americans,” said Rosenstein. “This case shows that we will pursue criminals involved in any type of scheme to deny people their hard-earned money.”</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the defendants ran an online gambling operation that accepted bets on sports, poker, and other games. The operation was based in Costa Rica, and utilized servers located in Canada and Panama. The defendants allegedly took in millions of dollars in illegal bets each year.</p>
<p>Eleven people were arrested as part of the operation, including the alleged ringleaders of the conspiracy. The defendants are all charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and operate an illegal gambling business. If convicted, they could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the DOJ has cracked down on illegal online gambling operations. In recent years, the department has undertaken a number of similar investigations, including “Black Friday” - a crackdown on several major poker websites that operated out of the United States.</p>
